# Action Network Wordpress Plugin

A free Wordpress plugin for the [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) online organizing tools, developed by [Jonathan Kissam](http://jonathankissam.com/).

Features:
* Create a Wordpress shortcode from any Action Network embed code
* Manage your saved embed codes using the Wordpress backend. Supports sorting by title, type and last modified date, and provides a search function.
* If you are an [Action Network Partner](https://actionnetwork.org/partnerships), use your API key to sync all of your actions from Action Network to Wordpress
* Provides an `actionnetwork_calendar` shortcode and Action Network Calendar widget to show a list of upcoming events. Development of this feature was supported by [The People's Lobby](http://www.thepeopleslobbyusa.org/) - if you like it, please consider [making a donation to them](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/donate-to-the-peoples-lobby).
